## Tasks Planned Today
Note: This query utilizes the Templater plugin to create the date parameters based on the note title. This assumes the Daily Note title format is set to `YYYY-MM-DD`. The benefit of this method is to allow you to create a particular day's note on any other day and still generate a valid query for that note's day.
